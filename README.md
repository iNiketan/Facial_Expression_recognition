train.py
contain code for building and traing nural network on the dataset
once dataset is trained save the model

Accuracy

run.py
which will load the saved model and run the model on a video feed taken by webcam
or the video passed

run_on_img.py
for image


todo:: code need cleaning and some modification
        work on increasing the accuracy of the model
